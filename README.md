## Clara Fuchshuber
Hi! I'm Clara, a first-year MURP/MPH student at UCLA concentrating in Community Economic Development and Housing. I mainly grew up in the Bay Area, and my profesional background is in healthcare and housing. 

> Interests:
- Housing 🏡
- Public health 
- Aging and urban design
- Tenancy and evictions
- Participatory Planning
- Food (making and eating), thrifting, tennis 🥘👚🎾 (:

## UP221 Project Ideas
My research ideas are still pretty unformed and broad, but a few areas of interest include: visualizing the eviction and landlord landscape in different neighborhoods in LA/Bay Area, especially as more landlords become larger entities rather than individuals; examining mobility landscape of historically redlined neighbrhoods, especially around vulnerable populations; looking at past suitable sites inventory and examining if development occured, if so what kind; or anything related to health and housing.

## Course Objectives
I'm hoping to set up a strong foundation in Python and technical data skills, as well as explore best practices around implementing data science and data visualization in future projects.
